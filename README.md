### Welcome to My GitHub Profile
Hi! I'm Gordon. You may know me from Discord (My Discord account/ Discord bot I made), my YouTube channel, my Instagram, my personal portfolio site... or if you haven't, nice to meet you 😊!

I'm a 19 y/o college undergrad student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), majoring in Electrical engineering. I have been programming since around 2022 (theoretically...), mostly self-taught and learned from high school subjects.

#

My first language was [Python](https://www.python.org/), which is still my main language, but I've used and still use a lot of other languages such as: JS/TS (with HTML & CSS), Docker, SQL (When I was in high school), C (For my flipper-zero), and R.

My language of preference depends on the project and how I feel, but generally:
- I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and Docker on large projects such as websites
- I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) (mainly) or JS/TS on small projects
- I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) or C for programs that require high-performance
- JS/TS, HTML5, CSS, and MongoDB are mostly used in web projects

My favorites are definitely Python and R; Python for flexibility and beginner-friendly, and R for awesome graph plotting and analysis.
